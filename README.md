<p>
An application for making multiple payments, managing assets, investing, saving and borrowing. <b>Designed for the end user</b>. This application seeks to provide ease in automating multiple payments or scheduling payments in blockchain to different applications or web3 services. We use the magic 🧙🏼 of <b>account abstraction</b> to achieve this.

Juick app is primarily <b>focused</b> on providing an <b>easy-to-use platform for DAOs</b> to make multiple payments in a single transaction, and those payments can be scheduled and pre-approved by other DAO members. This is our <b>main use case</b>, however, Juick app can be used and <b>integrated by any other</b> dApp, community, company or project that needs our service.

This project is mainly implemented in the <a href="https://www.etherlink.com/">Etherlink</a> protocol for its <i>speed</i> and <i>efficiency</i>, and also uses <a href="https://gateway.fm/presto/">Presto</a> and <a href="https://gateway.fm/#goods-sec">Gateway's oracle</a> to obtain instant currency values.
